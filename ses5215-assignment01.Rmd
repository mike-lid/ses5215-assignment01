# research question
How well does a census tract’s percentage of single-family homes and location relative to metropolitan center predict the average home value and tenure period in homes for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts?

# prior research
While the correlation between diversity of housing types and racial and economic diversity in 	neighborhoods have previously been established, this study investigated a potential 		relationship between housing typology and foreclosures. In fact, they found a positive 
(but varied) correlation between type and stability—neighborhoods with a range of housing stock had lower foreclosure and sales rates.
